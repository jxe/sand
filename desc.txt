Make your life beautiful.

Sand is a simple, visual calendar app.  Sand is ULTRA-FAST and MEGA-SIMPLE, gives you recommendations, and helps you think about your day.

- Drag-to-schedule: Sands dock makes it one drag to schedule common things.
- Uses gestures: What Clear did for lists, this does for your calendar.
- Gives you recommendations via Yelp and Pinterest, for cooking, nearby work caf√©s and parks, etc!
- Sand is easier to read than any other calendar, with beautifully photos of your friends and appointments.
- Sand reminds you of your mortality.
- Sand's dock and gestures help you "think out loud" about your day.
- Sand is made by one guy who loves you, not a startup!

App is very usable... Join us as we march towards 1.0, which will feature custom docks and images, a simple way to review days past, and more!
